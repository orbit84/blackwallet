		    <blockquote>
			    <p>Lumens are the native asset of the Stellar network.</p>
				<p>Native means that lumens are built into the network. Asset is how the network refers to an item of value that is stored on the ledger.</p>

				<p>One lumen is a unit of digital currency, like a bitcoin.<br/>

					While you can’t hold a lumen in your hand, they are essential to the Stellar network—they contribute to the ability to move money around the world and to conduct<br/> transactions between different currencies quickly and securely.

		    <blockquote>
			    <p>
			    	First, you need a wallet for this. Guess what? That's exactly what BlackWallet is!<br/>
			    	Then, you have to generate a key pair (a public and a private key), these are used to access to your wallet.
			    </p>
			    <p>The public key starts with a <b>G</b> while the secret key starts with a <b>S</b></p>
			    <p class="red-text text-lighten-3">
			    	You must absolutely keep secret your private key (which is actually called secret key), if someone else has access to it, he has access to your funds!
			    </p>
			    <p>
			    	To receive Lumens, you have to give your <u>public key</u> to the sender.

			    <p>You must keep safe your secret key, you can for example, write it on a paper or somewhere only you know and only you can access - that key is used to access to your wallet.</p>
			    <p class="red-text text-lighten-3">If you lose/forget your key, you will never have access to your wallet again.</p>

					Lumens are available for purchase on several known <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/#markets" target="_blank">markets and exchanges</a>.<br/>
